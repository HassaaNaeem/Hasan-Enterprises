You are a senior UI/UX designer tasked with creating a professional, production‑ready responsive web UI for Hasan Enterprises. Build interfaces that strictly implement the provided system design: use cases UC‑01 through UC‑10, the swimlane flow (milestones at 10%, 50%, 75%, 100%; meetings; reminders; legal escalation), and the object diagram entities and attributes exactly as listed. Do not add, rename, or remove any entities or attributes. 

 

TECH STACK CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY) 

- Runtime: Node.js 

- Framework: Express.js 

- Authentication: JWT-based auth with role-based access (Purchaser, Service Provider, Admin/Legal) 

- Database: MongoDB (document-based schema) 

- API Style: RESTful endpoints following Express.js conventions 

- All UI forms, tables, and components must bind to the exact entity names and attribute structures defined in the system design and object diagram. 

- JWT tokens must be handled via secure HTTP-only cookies or Authorization headers; UI must include login, logout, token refresh, and role-based route guarding. 

- MongoDB document IDs (_id) must be displayed or referenced in UI where needed (e.g., caseId, plotId, paymentId). 

 

Deliverables 

1. High‑fidelity responsive screens (desktop and mobile) for Purchaser, Service Provider, and Admin roles covering: 

   - Purchaser Dashboard, Plot Application (UC‑01), Payment Schedule (UC‑09), Make Payment (UC‑02), Document Center, Meetings Scheduler, Notifications. 

   - Service Provider Dashboard, Document Management, Payment Monitoring, Case Management, Meeting Scheduler. 

   - Admin/Legal Dashboard, Audit Logs, Reports. 

 

2. Component library and design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) with reusable components: Entity Card, Milestone Progress, Document Upload, Payment Row, Modal, Table, Notification Center. 

 

3. Clickable prototype demonstrating three critical flows: 

   - Select Plot and Submit Documents (UC‑01) 

   - Pay in accordance with payment schedule (UC‑02) 

   - Checkup with client about payment leading to Case Filed (UC‑03 → UC‑08) 

 

4. Developer handoff artifacts: 

   - Figma/Bolt file with components, variants, and tokens. 

   - JSON mapping file linking UI fields to backend entities and attributes exactly (e.g., plot.plotNumber → input.plotNumber). 

   - Exportable assets and CSS token values. 

 

Design and Interaction Rules 

- Use only the provided entities and attributes: Purchase, Place, Plot, Service Provider, Payment Schedule, Payment Installment, Failed Payment, Plot Details. 

- Treat document and image fields as secure URIs. 

- Milestone behavior must follow the swimlane: when cumulative payments reach 10%/50%/75%/100% of plot value, UI must surface document generation and meeting scheduling CTAs. 

- Overdue payments must show progressive reminders; after backend grace period, show Failed Payment and allow Service Provider to file a case; once case filed, mark plot On Hold and surface legal banner. 

- All forms must include inline validation, accessible labels, and localized strings for English and Urdu. 

- Sensitive fields (CNIC, bank statements) must be masked in UI and only accessible via secure document viewer using signed URIs. 

- Provide microcopy for all CTAs, confirmations, errors, and email/SMS notification templates. 

 

Node.js / Express / JWT / MongoDB UI Requirements 

- UI must include login and signup screens compatible with JWT authentication. 

- Role-based routing must be visually represented (Purchaser, Service Provider, Admin). 

- All API interactions must assume REST endpoints such as: 

  - POST /auth/login 

  - GET /plots/:id 

  - POST /payments/:id/pay 

  - POST /cases 

- MongoDB document structure must be reflected in UI forms and tables (e.g., _id, timestamps). 

- UI must support optimistic and pessimistic loading states for asynchronous Express.js API calls. 

- Error states must reflect typical Express.js error responses (400, 401, 403, 404, 500). 

 

Prototype Scenarios and Test Data 

- Include three sample user journeys with test data: (1) Purchaser applies and uploads CNIC and bank statement; (2) Purchaser makes 10% payment and signs allotment; (3) Purchaser misses payments, Service Provider records failed payment and files case. 

- Ensure prototype shows document URIs appearing only after backend confirmation steps. 

 

Handoff Checklist 

- Clickable prototype link. 

- JSON mapping file for backend integration. 

- Accessibility checklist and localization strings. 

- Acceptance criteria checklist mapped to UC‑01..UC‑10. 

 

Do not assume any additional backend fields or behaviors. If any required UI decision cannot be made from the provided use cases, swimlane, or object diagram, list a single clarifying question at the end of your delivery.
